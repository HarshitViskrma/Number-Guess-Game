# Number-Guess-Game
A number guessing game using Python's random module is a simple yet engaging program that tests a player's ability to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game starts by generating a random number using random.randint(), and the player is prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, and it can also track the number of attempts made. Additional functionalities can be added, such as setting a maximum number of attempts, allowing multiple difficulty levels, or giving hints based on the difference between the guessed and target numbers. This game helps beginners practice conditional statements, loops, and user input handling while exploring the functionality of Pythonâ€™s random module.
